    /*
    Definitions:
    -> An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
    -> When an exception occurs, Java creates an exception object that contains information about the error.

    -> Types of Exceptions:
        a. Checked Exceptions: Checked at compile-time. Eg. IOException, SQLException
        b. Unchecked Exceptions: Not checked at compile-tile but occur during runtime. Eg. ArithmeticException, NullPointerEx.
        c. Errors: Problems beyond control of the user or the programmer. Eg. OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError

    -> Exception Handling Keywords are:
        a. try - code that might throw an exception
        b. catch - catches and handles the exception
        c. finally - code that will run regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not
        d. throw - used to throw an exception explicitly
        e. throws - declares the exceptions that a method might throw
